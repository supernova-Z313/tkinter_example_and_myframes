## Requirements 🔧
Each file requires some different parts of the library, which we have discussed in detail in the *Requirement.txt* file, but in general, all files require the *Tkinter* library, which you can use the following command to install:

🔹Windows:

```console
pip install tk
```

🔹linux:
```console
pip3.X install tk
```

Or you can install all of them at the same time with the following command:

```console
pip3.X install -r Requirements.txt
```
